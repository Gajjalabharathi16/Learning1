Absolutely! You're doing great exploring shell scripting. Let's go through your script **line by line**, explain the purpose, and summarize what the script does overall.

---

### 🧾 **Purpose of the Script**

This shell script acts as a **background daemon** that **continuously monitors removable USB drives**. When a **USB partition is detected**:

* It attempts to **mount** it.
* If it has **files**, the script **wipes (deletes) all data**.
* It then **unmounts** the USB and removes the temporary mount folder.
* It logs all these events in `/var/log/usb_wipe.log`.

---

### 🧠 **Line-by-Line Explanation**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
```

* This tells the system to use **`bash`** to execute the script.

---

```bash
LOG_FILE="/var/log/usb_wipe.log"
```

* Sets a variable `LOG_FILE` to the path where all logs will be saved.

---

```bash
echo "$(date): USB wipe background daemon started" >> "$LOG_FILE"
```

* Logs the start of the daemon with the current date/time to the log file.

---

```bash
while true; do
```

* Starts an **infinite loop** to continuously check for USB drives every few seconds.

---

```bash
    while read -r line; do
```

* Starts reading each **line of output** from the upcoming `lsblk` command. This inner loop processes **each device**.

---

```bash
        eval "$line"  # Sets NAME, MOUNTPOINT, RM, TYPE
```

* `eval` turns the line from `lsblk` (like `NAME="sdb1" RM="1" TYPE="part"`) into **variables**: `NAME`, `RM`, `TYPE`, `MOUNTPOINT`.

---

```bash
        if [[ "$RM" -ne 1 || "$TYPE" != "part" ]]; then
            continue
        fi
```

* Skips the device if it's **not removable** (`RM != 1`) or **not a partition** (`TYPE != part`).

---

```bash
        DEVICE="/dev/$NAME"
        MOUNTPOINT="/mnt/usb_$NAME"
```

* Sets device path (e.g., `/dev/sdb1`) and a custom temporary mount point (e.g., `/mnt/usb_sdb1`).

---

```bash
        if mountpoint -q "$DEVICE"; then
            echo "$(date): $DEVICE is already mounted. Skipping." >> "$LOG_FILE"
            continue
        fi
```

* If the USB is **already mounted**, it logs the message and skips processing.

---

```bash
        mkdir -p "$MOUNTPOINT"
```

* Creates the mount directory if it doesn’t exist.

---

```bash
        if mount "$DEVICE" "$MOUNTPOINT" 2>>"$LOG_FILE"; then
            echo "$(date): Mounted $DEVICE at $MOUNTPOINT" >> "$LOG_FILE"
        else
            echo "$(date): Failed to mount $DEVICE manually. Skipping." >> "$LOG_FILE"
            continue
        fi
```

* Attempts to mount the USB manually.
* Logs success or failure accordingly.

---

```bash
        FILE_COUNT=$(find "$MOUNTPOINT" -mindepth 1 | wc -l)
```

* Counts files and directories inside the USB (excluding the root itself).

---

```bash
        if (( FILE_COUNT == 0 )); then
            echo "$(date): $DEVICE ($MOUNTPOINT) is empty. Nothing to wipe." >> "$LOG_FILE"
```

* If nothing is found, logs that nothing needs wiping.

---

```bash
        else
            echo "$(date): Data found on $DEVICE ($MOUNTPOINT). Wiping..." >> "$LOG_FILE"
            find "$MOUNTPOINT" -mindepth 1 -exec rm -rf {} \;
            echo "$(date): Wiped contents of $DEVICE ($MOUNTPOINT)" >> "$LOG_FILE"
        fi
```

* If data exists, logs it, deletes **all files/folders**, and logs the wipe.

---

```bash
        if umount "$DEVICE" 2>>"$LOG_FILE"; then
            echo "$(date): Unmounted $DEVICE from $MOUNTPOINT" >> "$LOG_FILE"
        else
            echo "$(date): Failed to unmount $DEVICE" >> "$LOG_FILE"
        fi
```

* Tries to unmount the USB and logs the result.

---

```bash
        rmdir "$MOUNTPOINT" 2>/dev/null
```

* Deletes the empty mount directory after unmounting. Errors (if any) are ignored.

---

```bash
    done < <(lsblk -P -o NAME,MOUNTPOINT,RM,TYPE)
```

* Feeds `lsblk` output (list of block devices) to the inner `while` loop. `-P` makes it parseable as `KEY="value"`.

---

```bash
    sleep 5
```

* Waits 5 seconds before rechecking for new USB devices.

---

```bash
done
```

* Ends the outer infinite loop.

---

### ✅ **What This Script Achieves**

* Runs forever in the background.
* Detects new removable USB partitions.
* If **not mounted**, it:

  * Mounts the USB.
  * Deletes all its contents if not empty.
  * Unmounts it.
* Keeps a log of all actions in `/var/log/usb_wipe.log`.

---

### ⚠️ **Caution**

This script **automatically deletes all data** on newly inserted USB drives. It’s powerful but dangerous in real systems without checks or confirmations.

Let me know if you'd like to:

* Add safety confirmations
* Limit to specific USB labels
* Run on startup
* Email logs or alerts

I'm happy to help!
